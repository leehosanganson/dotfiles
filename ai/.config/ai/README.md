# AI Configuration for OpenCode

This directory holds shared agents, commands, skills, and rules that feed into [OpenCode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode). All files are stored in `~/.dotfiles/ai/.config/ai/` and symlinked into `~/.config/opencode/`.

## Usage

### Using Rules (AGENTS.md)

To apply a rule to an OpenCode project, symlink it as `AGENTS.md` at the project root:

```bash
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/ai/.config/ai/rules/python-coding.md {PROJECT_ROOT}/AGENTS.md
```

To use these files with OpenCode, create symlinks from your dotfiles source to `~/.config/opencode/`. Run all the following commands once:

```bash
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/ai/.config/ai/agents ~/.config/opencode/agents
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/ai/.config/ai/commands ~/.config/opencode/commands
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/ai/.config/ai/skills ~/.config/opencode/skills
```
